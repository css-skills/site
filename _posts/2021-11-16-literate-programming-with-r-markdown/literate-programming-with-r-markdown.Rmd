title: "Literate programming with R Markdown"
description: |
  Literate programming is a technique for meshing source code with a human-readable explanation of its
  logic. This approach is used widely in data science and the social sciences to enable
  reproducible research and open access. In this workshop, we introduce the R Markdown document format
  and practice developing notebooks interweaving source code, output, and written text.
