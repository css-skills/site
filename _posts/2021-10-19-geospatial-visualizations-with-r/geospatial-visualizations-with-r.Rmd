## Overview

R contains many different packages for importing, structuring, and visualizing geospatial datasets. In this workshop we will consider two workflows for drawing geospatial data visualizations (aka data maps). In the first method we will obtain pre-generated mapping tiles from sources such as Stamen Maps using the `ggmap` package. With the second method, we will use spatial data files which contain detailed information to draw all the components of a map (e.g. points, lines, polygons) using the simple features framework and the `sf` package. These methods integrate directly into tidy workflows and visualization methods such as `ggplot2`.

## Objectives

- Introduce the major components of a geospatial visualization
- Identify how to obtain map tiles using `ggmap` and `get_map()`
- Generate plots overlaying data on raster map tiles
- Define common data structures for storing spatial data objects
- Import spatial data using the `sf` package
- Draw maps using `ggplot2` and `geom_sf()`
- Change coordinate systems

## Location

Room 295 in [1155 E 60th St](https://goo.gl/maps/7n7wDsd9mjnfRBtR8).
