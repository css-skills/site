title: "Geospatial visualizations with sf"
description: |
  R contains many different packages for importing, structuring, and visualizing geospatial datasets.
  A modern implementation, `sf`, uses the simple features format to encode spatial vector data. This
  method integrates directly into tidy workflows and visualization method such as `ggplot2`.
  In this workshop we will introduce the `sf` package and practice generating vector graphics for
  geospatial data using `ggplot2`.
