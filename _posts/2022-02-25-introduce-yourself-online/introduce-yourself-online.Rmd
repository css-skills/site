## Overview

A professional website is a great way to share information about yourself and your projects on the internet. However creating a website can seem daunting if you have never worked with HTML, CSS, or Javascript. In this workshop we will learn how to build websites using R, RStudio, and R Markdown.

## Objectives

- Identify the value of an online presence
- Create a basic GitHub profile
- Generate an "about" page using [`postcards`](https://github.com/seankross/postcards) and publish it with GitHub Pages
- Create a Markdown-based website using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [`blogdown`](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/blogdown/)
- Publish a version-controlled website on GitHub using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

## Audience

This workshop is designed for individuals who use R on a regular basis for data analysis. Prior experience with Git and GitHub is preferred but not essential.

## Location

**Note: This workshop meets on a special date and time (Friday February 25th from 9:30-12:20pm)!**
