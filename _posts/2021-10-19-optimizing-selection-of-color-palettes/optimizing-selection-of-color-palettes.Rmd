title: "Optimizing selection of color palettes"
description: |
  Researchers frequently use color to communicate numeric values in a data visualization.
  Most software will implement a default algorithm to select a color palette, and these
  palettes frequently are hard-to-interpret or are incompatible with common forms of color
  blindness. In this workshop we will develop approaches to readily generate optimized
  color palettes for continuous and categorical variables.
