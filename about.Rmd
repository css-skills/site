I am an Assistant Senior Instructional Professor in Computational Social Science and Associate Director of the [Masters in Computational Social Science](https://macss.uchicago.edu) at the University of Chicago. I teach learners social scientific research design, computational modeling, data science, math/statistics, and data visualization.

The Computational Social Science (CSS) Technical Skills Workshop meets biweekly on Tuesday afternoons.
