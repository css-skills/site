      "contents": "\nAbout\nThe Computational Social Science Technical Skills Workshop (or\nComputation Skills Workshop for short) trains participants in technical\nskills and methods which are relevant to computationally-driven\nresearch, but are not typically taught in for-credit courses. It\nprovides an explicit introduction to core software environments and\ninterfaces which impose a barrier to access for individuals lacking\nprior exposure to programming, and facilitates a community of\ncomputational researchers across the Division of the Social\nSciences. Individual workshops are designed for a range of technical\nbackgrounds, including purely introductory methods as well as\nintermediate or advanced training in specific software or computational\ntechniques. Workshops are designed for hands-on learning, and will\ninclude substantial live-coding exercises.\nThe workshop is organized by the Masters Program in Computational\nSocial Science at the University\nof Chicago and meets biweekly on Tuesdays from 3:30-5:20pm in room\n295 at 1155 E 60th\nSt. All members of the University community are invited to\nparticipate. Due to the ongoing public health crisis, all participants\nwill be required to register in advance for each workshop.\n\n\n\n",
