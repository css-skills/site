      <title>Introduction to Git and GitHub</title>
      <dc:creator>Benjamin Soltoff</dc:creator>
      <link>https://css-skills.uchicago.edu/posts/2022-03-08-introduction-to-git-and-github</link>
      <description>Version control software such as Git is essential for collaboration and version
tracking on data science projects, however the learning curve for Git is quite steep. In this
workshop we will introduce and practice common workflows using Git and GitHub.</description>

      <title>Interpreting and explaining machine learning models</title>
      <dc:creator>Benjamin Soltoff</dc:creator>
      <link>https://css-skills.uchicago.edu/posts/2022-02-15-interpretable-machine-learning-methods</link>
      <description>Machine learning algorithms are widely used in data science applications and have significant potential to improve predictions and understanding of social scientific processes. In many applications researchers need to be able to explain why the model made one prediction over another. In this workshop we introduce several techniques for interpreting black box models using model-agnostic techniques.</description>

      <title>Literate programming with R Markdown</title>
      <dc:creator>Benjamin Soltoff</dc:creator>
      <link>https://css-skills.uchicago.edu/posts/2021-11-16-literate-programming-with-r-markdown</link>
      <description>Literate programming is a technique for meshing source code with a human-readable explanation of its
logic. This approach is used widely in data science and the social sciences to enable
reproducible research and open access. In this workshop, we introduce the R Markdown document format
and practice developing notebooks interweaving source code, output, and written text.</description>

      <title>Optimizing selection of color palettes</title>
      <dc:creator>Benjamin Soltoff</dc:creator>
      <link>https://css-skills.uchicago.edu/posts/2021-11-02-optimizing-selection-of-color-palettes</link>
      <description>Researchers frequently use color to communicate numeric values in a data visualization.
Most software will implement a default algorithm to select a color palette, and these
palettes frequently are hard-to-interpret or are inaccessible to individuals with vision
impairments. In this workshop we will develop approaches to readily generate optimized
color palettes for continuous and categorical variables.</description>

      <title>Geospatial visualizations with R</title>
      <dc:creator>Benjamin Soltoff</dc:creator>
      <link>https://css-skills.uchicago.edu/posts/2021-10-19-geospatial-visualizations-with-r</link>
      <description>R contains many different packages for importing, structuring, and visualizing geospatial datasets.
In this workshop we will consider two workflows for drawing geospatial data visualizations (aka data maps)
using pre-generated mapping tiles as well as spatial vector datasets. These methods integrate
directly into tidy workflows and visualization methods such as `ggplot2`.</description>
