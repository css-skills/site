    "description": "Literate programming is a technique for meshing source code with a human-readable explanation of its\nlogic. This approach is used widely in data science and the social sciences to enable\nreproducible research and open access. In this workshop, we introduce the R Markdown document format\nand practice developing notebooks interweaving source code, output, and written text.",
