These tools can be used to improve data science workflows and computationally-enhanced research projects. However the learning curve for Git is quite steep, and often individuals are left to learn Git on their own with little explicit instruction. In this workshop we will introduce Git/GitHub and practice common workflows.\nObjectives\nIdentify the value of version control software for data science projects\nCreate repositories\nMake commits and synchronize repositories\nImplement collaborative workflows using branches and forks\nGenerate pull requests\nAudience\nThis workshop is designed for individuals with introductory-to-intermediate experience programming in a language such as Python or R.\nLocation\nRoom 295 in 1155 E 60th St.\nPrework\nRegister for this workshop.

    "contents": "\nOverview\nMachine learning algorithms are widely used in data science applications and have significant potential to improve predictions and understanding of social scientific processes. However machine learning models generally do not explain their predictions – they simply seek to minimize some loss function and provide for a given observation the probability of an event occurring. In many applications researchers need to be able to explain why the model made one prediction over another. This emphasis on interpretability is directly relevant to many social scientific questions, and can provide necessary context for decision makers who need to use machine learning models but lack a strong technical background. In this workshop we introduce several techniques for interpreting black box models using model-agnostic techniques.\nObjectives\nDefine interpretability and its importance to machine learning\nIdentify algorithms for interpretable models\nDefine model-agnostic methods for creating explanations\nImplement techniques for creating global model-agnostic explanations in R\nImplement techniques for creating local model-agnostic explanations in R\nAudience\nThis workshop is designed for individuals with introductory-to-intermediate knowledge of machine learning algorithms, as well as experience training machine learning models using R.
