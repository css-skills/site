    "description": "Literate programming is a technique for meshing source code with a human-readable explanation of its\nlogic. This approach is used widely in data science and the social sciences to enable\nreproducible research and open access. In this workshop, we introduce the R Markdown document format\nand practice developing notebooks interweaving source code, output, and written text.",

    "description": "R contains many different packages for importing, structuring, and visualizing geospatial datasets.\nA modern implementation, `sf`, uses the simple features format to encode spatial vector data. This\nmethod integrates directly into tidy workflows and visualization method such as `ggplot2`.\nIn this workshop we will introduce the `sf` package and practice generating vector graphics for\ngeospatial data using `ggplot2`.",

    "description": "Researchers frequently use color to communicate numeric values in a data visualization.\nMost software will implement a default algorithm to select a color palette, and these\npalettes frequently are hard-to-interpret or are incompatible with common forms of color\nblindness. In this workshop we will develop approaches to readily generate optimized\ncolor palettes for continuous and categorical variables.",
