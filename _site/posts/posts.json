    "contents": "\nOverview\nR contains many different packages for importing, structuring, and visualizing geospatial datasets. In this workshop we will consider two workflows for drawing geospatial data visualizations (aka data maps). In the first method we will obtain pre-generated mapping tiles from sources such as Stamen Maps using the ggmap package. With the second method, we will use spatial data files which contain detailed information to draw all the components of a map (e.g. points, lines, polygons) using the simple features framework and the sf package. These methods integrate directly into tidy workflows and visualization methods such as ggplot2.\nObjectives\nIntroduce the major components of a geospatial visualization\nIdentify how to obtain map tiles using ggmap and get_map()\nGenerate plots overlaying data on raster map tiles\nDefine common data structures for storing spatial data objects\nImport spatial data using the sf package\nDraw maps using ggplot2 and geom_sf()\nChange coordinate systems\nAudience\nThis workshop is designed for individuals with a basic familiarity using R and ggplot2 for data visualization.\nLocation\nRoom 295 in 1155 E 60th St.\nPrework\nRegister for this workshop.
